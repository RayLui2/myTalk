To run my program, run the command "make mytalk", to get rid of object files,
run "make clean". Running it follows the specs/guidelines.

-v turns on verbose, gives the user more statements of what is happening during
the process of connections.

-a only applies to the server, the server accepts all connections.

-N turns off windowing mode, when N flag is not present, windowing will be on.

In the terminal(NON WINDOW MODE), the user must hit CTRL D twice IF there the
user has typed a message beforehand, your program does this too :). If there is
no text, CTRL D only needs to be typed once.
